# openapi-generator

This project is in very early development. Things to add:

 - [x] tags need to be made into their own module
 - [ ] convert this project into an npm package
 - [ ] create template repo, where a user can run `bun create openapi-generator@latest`
 - [ ] auto genearte example data for fields based on type using faker
 - [ ] schema type is wrong but is functioning with very basic schemas, needs a lot more work
 - [ ] more things are supposed to be added to the components
 - [ ] check types against the specification
 - [ ] add optional `outputPath` field to the serve function, will write openapi.json to this
 - [ ] write full proper README.md
